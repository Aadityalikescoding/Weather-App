# Smart Farming Weather App

This project is more than just a typical weather application — it’s designed with a smart farming perspective. The goal is to provide farmers with real-time weather insights and environmental data that can support better crop planning, irrigation management, and risk reduction.

## Key Features:

Live weather updates based on location

Forecasting models for temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind

Dashboard with smart alerts for extreme weather conditions

Modular design to integrate with IoT devices and sensors (e.g., soil moisture, pH levels)

Future scope: crop recommendation engine based on weather and soil data


## Purpose: Smart Farming leverages data and digital tools to help farmers make informed decisions. This app aims to be a stepping stone towards that goal by combining real-time weather data with actionable insights for agriculture.

## Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Leaflet.js for interactive maps)

Backend: Node.js / Flask (future expansion)

APIs: OpenWeatherMap API (initially), scalable to agri-specific datasets

Deployment: GitHub Pages / Docker-ready
